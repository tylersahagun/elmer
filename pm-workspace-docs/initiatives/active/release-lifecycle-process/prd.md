# Release Lifecycle Process PRD

## Overview

- **Owner:** Tyler Sahagun (Process), Product Team (Adoption)
- **Target Release:** Q1 2026 (Process by Jan 31, Beta UI by Mar 1)
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Strategic Pillar:** Customer Trust + Quality Over Velocity
- **2026 Initiative:** Foundation (enables all 2026 initiatives to ship cleanly)

This initiative establishes AskElephant's standardized release lifecycle: **Alpha → Invite-only Beta → Open Beta → GA → Launch**. It defines stage criteria, TTLs, communication contracts, and ships a self-serve beta toggle UI for users.

---

## Outcomes Framework

### Customer Outcome

**Target State:** Users can discover and try new features on their terms through a clear beta program, with transparent expectations about feature maturity.

**Current State:**

- Users don't know what's in beta vs. stable
- No self-serve way to try new features early
- Feature availability feels random/inconsistent

**Gap:** No user-facing beta program or clear maturity indicators in the product.

### Business Outcome

**Target State:** Faster feature delivery to customers with clear process, improved GTM coordination, and reduced internal confusion about feature readiness.

**How this drives:**

- [x] **Land** - Better demos (Sales shows what customers will see)
- [x] **Expand** - Faster feature delivery = more value = expansion
- [x] **Retain** - Consistent experience = fewer support failures = retention

### Success Metrics

| Metric                         | Type    | Current    | Target    | Owner   |
| ------------------------------ | ------- | ---------- | --------- | ------- |
| Features with defined stage    | Leading | ~30%       | 100%      | Tyler   |
| Features exceeding TTL         | Leading | Unknown    | <10%      | Tyler   |
| Revenue team release awareness | Leading | Low        | >90%      | Tyler   |
| Time from Alpha → GA (median)  | Lagging | 18+ months | <6 months | Product |
| Beta feature opt-in rate       | Lagging | N/A        | >5%       | Product |

### Success Criteria

| Criteria                      | Target                   | Timeline     | How We'll Measure  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------ |
| Stage definitions approved    | 100% leadership sign-off | Jan 20, 2026 | Meeting outcome    |
| All flags have stage metadata | 100% tagged              | Jan 31, 2026 | PostHog audit      |
| Weekly release notes running  | 4 consecutive weeks      | Feb 15, 2026 | Meeting attendance |
| Beta toggle UI shipped        | Live in prod             | Mar 1, 2026  | Deployment         |
| Revenue team confidence       | >90% feel informed       | Mar 15, 2026 | Survey             |

## Outcome Chain

```
Standardized release lifecycle enables clear stage definitions
  → so that features progress through Alpha → Invite-only Beta → Open Beta → GA with defined TTLs
    → so that users can self-serve into beta features with clear expectations
      → so that Revenue teams always know feature availability
        → so that customers receive consistent experience and support
          → so that NRR improves through reduced churn and faster expansion
```

## Problem Statement

### The Problem

AskElephant has no standardized process for how features move from idea to customer hands. This causes:

1. **Ambiguous feature states** - Is this beta? GA? Nobody knows
2. **Revenue team blindsides** - Learn about changes from customers
3. **Stale betas** - Features stuck in "beta" for 18+ months
4. **No user agency** - Users can't try new features on their terms
5. **Release/Launch confusion** - Teams conflate technical release with marketing launch

### Evidence

**Leadership quotes (Jan 13, 2026):**

> "I forgot that I get access to everything. And so I was like, oh, this is - I actually love this tool, but no one else has access to it." — Woody

> "Customers will churn over things or be dissatisfied, and it's simply because we couldn't support them appropriately." — Ben Harrison

> "Release and launch don't have to happen like, bang bang." — Tony

**Industry research:**

- Short-lived flags are essential (Unleash, LaunchDarkly best practices)
- Progressive rollouts minimize risk
- Clear TTLs prevent "beta limbo"

---

## Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals (Measurable)

1. **Define and adopt release lifecycle** - Alpha/Invite-only Beta/Open Beta/GA with TTLs
2. **100% stage coverage** - Every feature flag has a defined stage
3. **Ship beta toggle UI** - Users can self-serve into beta features
4. **Establish communication contract** - Weekly release notes, Slack announcements
5. **<10% TTL violations** - Features progress or get deprecated, not stuck

### Non-Goals

- **Not changing innovation culture** - Engineers can still experiment freely in Alpha
- **Not requiring marketing approval for releases** - Release ≠ Launch
- **Not building full "Labs" product** - Settings toggle is sufficient for Phase 1
- **Not enforcing hard TTL blocks** - Soft reminders, not blockers

---

## User Personas

### Primary: Revenue Team (Sales, CS)

- **Job-to-be-done:** Demo and support customers with accurate feature knowledge
- **Current pain:** Don't know what's available to whom; blindsided by changes
- **Success looks like:** Always know feature status; confident in demos/support
- **Trust factors:** Consistent weekly updates; single source of truth

### Secondary: AskElephant Users (Admins, Power Users)

- **Job-to-be-done:** Get maximum value from AskElephant
- **Current pain:** Miss out on features; don't know what's available to try
- **Success looks like:** Can discover and enable beta features easily
- **Trust factors:** Clear "beta" expectations; easy opt-out if issues

### Tertiary: Product/Engineering

- **Job-to-be-done:** Ship features to customers efficiently
- **Current pain:** Unclear when something is "done"; features languish
- **Success looks like:** Clear path from code to customer with defined stages
- **Trust factors:** Process enables velocity, doesn't slow it down

## Scope

### In Scope (Phase 1)

**Process:**

- Stage definitions (Alpha, Invite-only Beta, Open Beta, GA)
- TTL definitions (90/60/90 days)
- Entry/exit criteria for each stage
- Communication contract documentation
- Weekly release notes cadence

**Product:**

- Beta toggle UI in Settings
- Stage badge component (Alpha, Beta)
- PostHog stage metadata tagging
- Feature status dashboard (internal)

### Out of Scope (Future)

- Full "Labs" product experience (separate initiative)
- Automated TTL enforcement/alerts
- In-app changelog/release notes for customers
- Customer-facing beta program marketing
- Workspace-level beta blocking (admin prevents users from enabling)

### Future Considerations

- Labs product could be P2 initiative
- Consider automating Slack announcements from PostHog
- Customer-facing beta program with rewards/recognition

### Beta Toggle UI Flow

1. **Entry:** User navigates to Settings → Beta Features
2. **View:** List of available beta features with descriptions
3. **Action:** Toggle feature ON
4. **Feedback:** Toast: "Enabled! Look for the Beta badge in [location]"
5. **Discovery:** Feature appears in app with 🟡 Beta badge

### Key UI Components

| Component                | Location      | Purpose                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Beta Features Settings   | Settings page | Toggle beta features           |
| Stage Badge              | Feature areas | Indicate maturity (Alpha/Beta) |
| Beta Toast               | Global        | Confirm toggle action          |
| Release Status Dashboard | Internal tool | Track all features by stage    |

---

## Technical Considerations

### PostHog Integration

- Add `stage` metadata to all feature flags
- Add `ttl_start` and `ttl_days` metadata
- Create "beta_enrolled" user group for public beta cohort
- Track `beta_feature_enabled` and `beta_feature_disabled` events

### API Requirements

- `GET /api/beta-features` - List available beta features for user
- `POST /api/beta-features/{key}/toggle` - Enable/disable feature
- `GET /api/beta-features/status` - Internal dashboard data

### Frontend Components

- `<BetaFeaturesSettings />` - Settings panel
- `<StageBadge stage="beta" />` - Reusable badge
- `<BetaFeatureCard />` - Individual feature toggle

## Communication Contract

### Stage Transition Notifications

| Transition         | Notify                  | Channel                | Timing        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------- |

## Open Questions

1. [ ] **TTL enforcement:** Soft reminder or hard block when TTL exceeded?
2. [ ] **Concurrent beta limit:** Cap at 5 open betas? Or no limit?
3. [ ] **Workspace override:** Can admins disable beta access for their workspace?
4. [ ] **Feedback mechanism:** In-app feedback for beta features?
5. [ ] **Alpha visibility:** Should Alpha features be visible to power users?

---
