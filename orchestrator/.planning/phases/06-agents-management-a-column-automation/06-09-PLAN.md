  <what-built>Complete Agents Management and Column Automation system</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Agents Management UI (AGUI-01 to AGUI-06):**

1. **AGUI-01 - Navigation**
   - Open workspace
   - Click hamburger menu
   - Verify "run agents" link is visible
   - Click it - should navigate to /workspace/[id]/agents

2. **AGUI-02 - Agent List**
   - Verify agents page shows all imported agents
   - Agents should be grouped by type (AGENTS.md, Skills, Commands, etc.)
   - Each agent shows name and description

3. **AGUI-03 - Agent Details**
   - Click on an agent card to expand
   - Verify it shows metadata:
     - Skills: triggers, workflow, output paths
     - Commands: usage, steps, delegates to
     - Subagents: model, readonly, context files
     - Rules: globs, always apply

4. **AGUI-04 - Agent Execution**
   - Click "Execute" on an agent
   - Select "Project" context
   - Choose a project
   - Click Execute
   - Verify job is created (toast appears)

5. **AGUI-05 - Execution History**
   - Expand agent card
   - Verify execution history section shows
   - Previous executions display with status, timestamp, context

6. **AGUI-06 - Enable/Disable**
   - Click toggle on an agent card
   - Verify agent becomes disabled (visual indication)
   - Verify Execute button is disabled
   - Toggle back on - agent enabled again

**Column Automation (AUTO-01 to AUTO-06):**

7. **AUTO-01 & AUTO-04 - Automation Configuration**
   - Navigate to workspace settings
   - Find Column Automation section
   - Verify each column has configuration UI
   - Add an agent as automation trigger
   - Save - verify persists on page reload

8. **AUTO-02 - Auto-Trigger on Drag**
   - Configure an agent to trigger on a column (e.g., PRD column)
   - Drag a project to that column
   - Verify job is created automatically
   - Check job list or logs for new automation job

9. **AUTO-03 - pm-workspace Patterns**
   - Verify automation configuration matches expected patterns
   - Agent triggers stored in column config

10. **AUTO-05 - Loop Prevention**
    - Rapidly drag project back and forth to same column
    - Verify automation doesn't create unlimited jobs
    - Check console for "Loop prevention" messages

11. **AUTO-06 - Status Badge**
    - After dragging project (triggering automation)
    - Check project card for status badge
    - Badge should show:
      - Blue spinner while running
      - Green check when completed
      - Red X if failed
    - Click badge - opens job details

Report any issues found during verification.
