# Phase 14.5 Plan 03: Video Link UI Summary

**VideoLinkTab component with YouTube URL input, integrated as third tab in CreateSignalModal**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-23T16:59:18Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-23T17:00:22Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- Created VideoLinkTab component with URL input, interpretation textarea, and fetch mutation
- Integrated VideoLinkTab as third tab in CreateSignalModal
- Three-tab modal: Paste Text, Upload File, Video Link
- Loading and error states with appropriate UI feedback

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create VideoLinkTab component** - `b15ea87` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Integrate VideoLinkTab into CreateSignalModal** - `3acb3aa` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `orchestrator/src/components/signals/VideoLinkTab.tsx` - Video URL input component with fetch mutation
- `orchestrator/src/components/signals/CreateSignalModal.tsx` - Updated with three tabs including Video Link

## Decisions Made
- Client-side URL validation for UX hints (youtube/youtu.be/loom.com) - server performs real validation
- Video icon in submit button when idle, spinner when loading - visual feedback pattern
- Same prop interface as FileUploadTab for consistency (workspaceId, onSuccess, onClose)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Video caption fetch flow complete from UI to API to caption extraction
- Phase 14.5 (Video Caption Fetch) is now complete
- Ready to continue with Phase 15 or other signals system phases
