# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 12.5-01
    provides: Signal-project linking API endpoints
  - phase: 12.5-02
    provides: Signal association UI patterns
provides:
  - Project-centric signal viewing via LinkedSignalsSection
  - Bulk signal linking via SignalPickerModal
  - Checkbox UI primitive from shadcn/ui
affects: [13-ai-classification, 14-intelligence-layer]

key-decisions:
  - "Section collapsed by default to reduce visual noise"
  - "Filter out already-linked signals in picker to prevent duplicates"
  - "Sequential linking in bulk operation for simplicity"

patterns-established:
  - "Collapsible section pattern: ChevronRight rotates 90deg when expanded"
  - "Bulk selection modal: Checkbox + search + footer with count-aware button"

# Phase 12.5 Plan 04: Project-Side Signals Section Summary

**Collapsible signals section on project page with bulk linking modal for project-centric signal management**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 8 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-22T23:58:35Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-23T00:06:09Z
- **Tasks:** 4
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments
- Collapsible "Signals (N)" section on project detail page showing linked evidence
- SignalPickerModal for multi-select bulk linking of signals to projects
- Checkbox UI primitive added for shadcn/ui component library
- Full project-centric association workflow enabled

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Install shadcn/ui Checkbox component** - `60c7965` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create LinkedSignalsSection component** - `86efc57` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Create SignalPickerModal for bulk linking** - `64777be` (feat)
4. **Task 4: Integrate signals section into ProjectDetailPage** - `8e0bf9d` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `orchestrator/src/components/ui/checkbox.tsx` - shadcn/ui Checkbox using Radix primitives
- `orchestrator/src/components/projects/LinkedSignalsSection.tsx` - Collapsible signals list with unlink capability
- `orchestrator/src/components/projects/SignalPickerModal.tsx` - Multi-select modal for bulk signal linking
- `orchestrator/src/app/(dashboard)/projects/[id]/ProjectDetailPage.tsx` - Integration point for signals section

## Decisions Made
- Section collapsed by default to reduce initial visual noise on project page
- Filter out already-linked signals in picker modal to prevent duplicate linking attempts
- Sequential linking in bulk operation (simple loop) rather than parallel requests for stability

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - all tasks completed without issues.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Project-side signals section complete
- Both association workflows now available:
  - Signal-centric: From signal detail, link to projects
  - Project-centric: From project page, bulk link signals
- Ready for Phase 13: AI Classification
