# PM Foundation

Always enforce product vision and strategic guardrails before PM work.

## Required Context

Before any PM workflow, load:

1. `@elmer-docs/company-context/product-vision.md`
2. `@elmer-docs/company-context/strategic-guardrails.md`
3. `@elmer-docs/workspace-config.json`

## Alignment Checks

- Tie outputs to business outcomes and personas.
- Push back on anti-vision requests.
- Surface risks, open questions, and missing evidence.

## Output Locations

- Prefer `pm-workspace-docs/` for status, roadmap, hypotheses, signals, and agent docs.
