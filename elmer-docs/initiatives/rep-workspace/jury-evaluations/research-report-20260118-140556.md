## 7. CRITICAL FRICTION POINTS

These are the top issues that would cause user abandonment:

1. **Unclear feedback on sync status** - 10 personas flagged this
2. **Rollback if something breaks** - 9 personas flagged this
3. **Integration with existing tools** - 8 personas flagged this
4. **Configuration complexity** - 7 personas flagged this
5. **Compliance/security concerns** - 5 personas flagged this

## 8. SAMPLE VOICE FEEDBACK

Real feedback from synthetic users (in character):


> **sales-rep / early-adopter [REJECT]:**
> "This is exactly what I've been looking for. The transparency features are key - I want to see what it's doing."


> **sales-rep / skeptic [REJECT]:**
> "I'm not opposed to AI, I'm opposed to hype. Show me the ROI, show me it works, then we can talk."


> **sales-rep / curious [REJECT]:**
> "Interesting approach to the configuration problem. I'd want to pilot this with a small group first."


> **sales-rep / skeptic [REJECT]:**
> "Look, I've been burned by these AI tools before. I need to see exactly what it's doing before I trust it with my pipeline."


> **strategic-consultant / early-adopter [CONDITIONAL]:**
> "Love the direction. Just need better preview/testing capabilities before pushing to the whole team."

## 9. ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on jury feedback, prioritized recommendations:

### Must Have (Address Before Launch)
1. **Visibility/Transparency** - Show exactly what will sync before it syncs
2. **Testing Capability** - Provide sandbox/preview mode for configuration
3. **Rollback Mechanism** - Easy way to undo if something breaks

### Should Have (High Priority)
4. **Activity Log** - Clear audit trail of all actions taken
5. **Gradual Rollout** - Ability to pilot with subset of team
6. **Templates** - Pre-built configurations for common use cases

### Nice to Have (Future Iterations)
7. **API Access** - For power users who want custom workflows
8. **Mobile View** - Status monitoring on the go
9. **ROI Dashboard** - Quantify time savings

## 10. CONDORCET CONFIDENCE ANALYSIS

According to Condorcet's Jury Theorem:
- **Individual Accuracy Assumption:** ~65% (based on informed user evaluations)
- **Jury Size:** {jury_size}
- **Statistical Confidence:** {confidence_desc}

The probability that the majority verdict is correct approaches certainty with jury sizes > 50 when individual accuracy exceeds 50%.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Revisit problem framing and conduct additional user research
2. Interview real skeptic personas to understand rejection reasons
3. Consider pivoting approach based on feedback themes
