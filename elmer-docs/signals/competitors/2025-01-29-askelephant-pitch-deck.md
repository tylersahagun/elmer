## Their "Era" Framework

### Era 1: Data Capture

- Tools: Fathom, Gong, Fireflies
- Problem: Only captures data, doesn't act on it

### Era 2: Automation (Where competitors are)

- Tools: Momentum, Attention, Sybill
- Problem: "Tasks automated in silos," agents don't learn, benefits don't compound

### Era 3: Infrastructure/Orchestration (Their claim)

- AskElephant's positioning
- "Systems trigger systems autonomously"
- "Agents learn from manager feedback (ALHF)"
- "Skills compound over time"

## 3-Layer Architecture

| Layer   | Description          | Status                |
| ------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Layer 1 | Data Foundation      | Built                 |
| Layer 2 | Agent Workflows      | Built                 |
| Layer 3 | Seamless Integration | Building (Q3-Q4 2026) |

**Layer 3 Vision:** "Like Cursor for engineers" - conducting lead agents that autonomously manage sub-agents.

---

## Claimed Differentiation (Moats)

### Moat 1: Cross-Functional Data

- 5x more context (Sales + Onboarding + CS + Product)
- "Patterns humans can't see"
- Super-intelligent agents that know YOUR workflows

### Moat 2: ALHF (Agent Learning from Human Feedback)

- Manager edits ONE agent → All 50 agents learn instantly
- Gets smarter with YOUR workflows
- "After 6 months, knows you better than any template"

### Moat 3: Platform Expansion

- 60% non-sales adoption (vs 5-10% industry avg)
- 50% expansion revenue
- Network effects across teams

---

## Product Vision (Slide 6)

**Agent Types:**

1. **Chief of Staff Agent** - Daily briefing (5 sub-agents: calendar, email, pipeline, CS alerts, tasks)
2. **Coaching Agent** - Meeting prep (analyzed 47 calls to surface winning patterns)
3. **Admin Agent** - Post-call (3 sub-agents: CRM update, email draft, CS notification)

**Key Phrase:** "You conduct lead agents. They autonomously manage sub-agents."

## Strategic Analysis for elmer

### Different Markets, Some Overlap

| Dimension          | AskElephant                           | elmer                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Market** | Revenue teams (Sales, CS, Onboarding) | Product teams (PMs, Engineering)         |
| **Core Problem**   | Revenue operations efficiency         | Discovery compression, engineering waste |
| **Agent Focus**    | Execution agents (do work)            | Orchestration agents (manage workflow)   |
| **Validation**     | Manager feedback (ALHF)               | Prototype + jury validation              |
| **End Goal**       | "AI-native revenue team"              | "Validated prototype → engineering"      |

### Interesting Concepts to Monitor

1. **ALHF (Agent Learning from Human Feedback)**
   - They scale learning from one edit to all agents
   - Relevant to elmer's "iteration" feedback loops
   - Question: How does elmer's jury/iteration feedback compound?

2. **"Era" Framing**
   - Effective positioning against point solutions
   - elmer could use similar framing: Era 1 (docs) → Era 2 (tools like Notion/Linear) → Era 3 (orchestrated discovery)

3. **Sub-Agent Architecture**
   - Lead agents managing sub-agents is similar to elmer's stage-based automation
   - Their "Chief of Staff" pattern = elmer's "PM copilot" pattern

4. **Platform Expansion Strategy**
   - 60% non-sales adoption shows cross-functional value
   - elmer's path: PM → Engineering → Design → GTM?

### Not a Direct Threat Because

1. **Different buyer:** They sell to revenue leadership, elmer sells to product teams
2. **Different problem:** They optimize execution, elmer compresses discovery
3. **Different output:** They produce "done tasks," elmer produces "validated prototypes"

### Watch For

1. **Product team expansion** - If they move from RevOps to ProductOps
2. **Prototype/validation features** - If they add pre-build validation
3. **"Discovery" language** - If they start using discovery compression messaging

## Key Quotes

> "The real problem isn't automation—it's process integration"

> "Infrastructure compounds. Point solutions don't."

> "Every manager interaction trains the agents. Every agent execution generates organizational intelligence."

> "They're perfecting Era Two while we're building Era Three"

---

## Hypothesis Candidates

Based on this competitor analysis:

1. **"Era" positioning could differentiate elmer from Notion/Linear**
   - Era 1: Static docs (Notion)
   - Era 2: Project tools (Linear/Jira)
   - Era 3: Orchestrated discovery (elmer)
   - Hypothesis: Framing elmer as "Era 3 for Product" could accelerate positioning

2. **Agent learning loops are valuable**
   - Their ALHF scales learning across agents
   - Question: How does elmer's jury feedback compound? Does iteration on one prototype improve future prototypes?

3. **Cross-functional expansion validates platform play**
   - 60% non-sales adoption suggests teams want unified systems
   - Hypothesis: elmer's PM → Eng → Design expansion could follow similar pattern

---

## Action Items

- [ ] Monitor AskElephant for product team features
- [ ] Consider "Era" positioning framework for elmer marketing
- [ ] Explore: How can iteration feedback compound across prototypes?
- [ ] Review: Is elmer's agent architecture similar to their sub-agent pattern?
