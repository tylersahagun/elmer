The other piece that I want to add is, um, the ability to achieve how automated or how involve, um, you're thinking of the process. So, For example, um, like for that initial discovery, as soon as the transcripts move, I actually want the option to be able to have a PRD generated, um, Then after the period, you know, automatically just gonna go create the, The PRDs made his art, you can automatically create like the design, the initial go to market for you. engineering spec, the design spec, and just create that 1st prototype. So I want to be able to put lines and designations into where human buildings are involved. So that entire 1st piece, I want to be able to say, hey, they can automate this entire process, really without concern. And then I don't want to be notified until I get the, um, that 1st prototype to look at. Um, So that should be a configuration piece on how much or how little the automation is actually happening between lanes.
