A lot of the main functionality of the application is working. But I want to talk through the user experience and some of the actual cases of how I want to be using this and where I want a lot of the information to be coming from. So I've spent a lot of time working on a separate workspace that lives inside Cursor and it's my TM workspace. Inside this TM workspace, I have a submodule which is this Elephant AI, and that is the codebase that I'm working on. So I'm a product manager for AskElephant, and that's the code that I want it to do work in. And so this workspace is basically meant to contain all the projects I'm doing around this codebase. So prototypes that I generate will be inside the Elephant submodule, but then there's also contexts and things that I want to add. Inside of the TM workspace, I have my app TM workspace docs, and I have my agent docs, my audit, my company context, floating docs, hypotheses, initiatives, knowledge base sink, maintenance meeting notes, personal reflections, personas, research roadmaps, scenario scripts, signals and status. So all of these things have information inside the reading about what they do, but the PM workspace docs is actually all of this should be reflected inside Elmer at some point for example. Company context is what I should be able to see inside Elmer underneath the CD files that has the domain name/knowledge base and the initiatives or projects that I'm working on, and each project has the documents that are created for it and the meeting notes, personal reflections, personas. I would expect to be inside that personas domain too when I sync to it, and signals is like an inbox of documentation of things similar to the context of what I want to be done. And then the @AGENTS.md has more information. But the general PM workspace also has the @AGENTS.md file which has all the information about how I want the context to flow, all the layers, um, agents I see as like the work that is done, the context that it has, and each of those have commands that they will work under and then rules for the workspace as well as skills have a whole skills portfolio. So when I am working inside Elmer, I actually just want to be able to have all of the functionality of this PM workspace with all of the commands. So I would expect that when I create a new project, it will ask me first like an onboarding carousel to connect my GitHub repo. And when I connect my repo, I would select the PM workspace, and then it would ask like what contacts that I have, what projects I have, where my initiatives are, all of those things. And it would automatically create that context and then make suggestions for what columns there should be, what work is done by each agent, and going through all of the steps of what my reading has. So right now I have the workspace settings page, and most of this should be configured when you create a new project like in onboarding carousel asking you for this. And um, almost like using the "get stuff done" questioning flow to figure out those things. So, like, in general, the repository, prototypes, context path to GitHub write back, agent architecture, get automation, all that should be part of the carousel with just like a natural chat of going through finding that information and the pipeline configuration for the columns, the work to be done, the automation, like the knowledge based publishing, all this should be synced to individual places in the repo. Um, same with the execution and automation connecting services through Composeo. Like right now I can do that in the workspace page, but doesn't actually do anything, so all of that should be configured in an onboarding carousel originally. So pause there.Once I hit Create Workspace, what I would expect then is using the PMWorks list as an example is all of the initiatives that I currently have listed would be projects that are created and in varying different stages based on the status of what's been done, what the next suggestions are. So I would expect to see my admin onboarding, an automated metric observability call import engine, Composio agent framework, all of those things. And let's take like the CRM readiness diagnostic initiative I have in that repo for example, that would be a product, and if I click on it I would be able to see my decisions file, my placement research, my PRD, my prototype notes, my research, the jury evaluations, and then the Meta.json should also help give information to where it's at in different processes if there's a prototype that is connected to it, information like that. So I would be able to see each of those initiatives and then the other piece is that I can I would be able to click on the hamburger menu, click on the CD files, it would navigate me to the knowledge base, and I would see all of the context that I have in my PM workspace docs underneath like my agent docs, the company contacts, floating docs, knowledge basing, anything that's going to be used to process those jobs and be able to both add information to it and edit it like the company concepts we have the integrations, org chart, personas, product vision research, all of that. Then I would also be able to go to the hamburger menu and then click on personas, and that would map to in my PM workspace docs the personas that I have listed, and then there's those subfolders of the personas or customers and then the archetypes and the generated personas and then the jury system reading to get that information. And then all of the jobs would give to use those personas, and if I were to navigate to the signals inside that workspace, it would also go to the PM workspace docs, go signals, and there would be those conversations, those documents, issues, releases, tickets, transcripts, and be able to work with each of those. Then the other piece is that inside of the settings, I would want to be able to see or maybe even have a separate hamburger menu option like Agents or Commands or Jobs, something like that. That relates to the.cursor file that I have at a high level. So the.cursor file has where my Agents, my Commands, my Rules, and my Skills are, and most of that is dictated at the root with the @AGENTS.md that has the whole list of agent instructions. So I'd be able to go to an agents page and it would say what each of the agents are, the skills that they use, the work they have to do, and the jobs that they can run. And from each of those agents, be able to select projects or signals or whatever context is that they use and actually have work run on the projects that I have. Now this would also mean that for each column in my Kanban view, I can as I drag and drop as I view projects, the columns themselves have different auto-runs configured based on what is inside my PM workspace. So all of this is contingent on having that onboarding carousel process to go through and say what is the existing framework that there is on this GitHub repo? Where would information be saved? All of the work that Elmer does should be created not locally in Elmer but to that PM workspace to that GitHub repo. So when a new PRD is created, for example, that if I have a initiative, the CRM exp - e-t-e, the CRM end experience, and a PRD is created, it's updated, it updates it in the GitHub repo, it's creating those commits. So in the same way that the Get Shit Done framework actually goes through and analyzes that process and then makes like atomic commits, each work to be done would be like an atomic commit that is already being pushed to the repo. All this is contingent on when you create a project, it having an onboarding carousel where it asks you what GitHub repo you're connecting to and having that actual GitHub connection piece. Then, when you paste it in, doing that analysis. I imagine having a chat window, like a chat agent, very similar to the Get Shit Done framework, to ask how do you actually go about configuring the repo and connecting it to these different pieces across the application? Like the integrations that need to be used, what the goal is, where context is made, and just continually asking questions until it is extremely clear where work actually needs to go, the context that's being used and what that system looks like. So the question is, or the goal is, that this is how I want to do it for myself, but there is the case of people that may not have an existing framework. Like they want to start from scratch, so what happens then? And that would be the case where Elmer would create... it would say like, do you have an existing workspace? Or do you want to use a template? What kind of work are you trying to get done? What is the flow? And go through that same Git Shit Done question and framework to help explain what work actually needs to be processed. So if there isn't an existing GitHub framework that has like this full built out thing, then it should be a genericized template of what I have inside of my PM workspace docs, where the actual commands, the structure, all of that is almost the exact same. The biggest thing that changes is the context of the user themselves, so it wouldn't have like the Tyler context. You would have to go through and ask questions about that instead. It would be about their company, so maybe part of it would be asking for a company URL, doing research on the web for it, and automatically generating some of that content. And all of that is like the onboarding process in a carousel inside of a chat for any given new project. So then, once that's completed, having like an onboarding quick free tour of how all of the components work together and where stuff is actually created. The other thing that's important to note is that because my PM workspace uses a sub-module of AskElephant, the prototypes are actually generated and a lot of the context that it's using is from that sub-module. So I want to make sure that Elmer can actually work inside of that sub-module, continue to make prototypes in that same directory without having issues. That shouldn't change. For example, in the PM workspace, it has the sub-module of Elephant AI, and if I go to where work is done, it's inside of the Elephant AI/web/SRC/components/prototypes. That's what I would expect Elmer to do. So a lot of the base framework is there, but it's about putting those pieces together and changing it. I want to completely revamp the settings page inside of a project to make sure that we're inside of a workspace so that the work can be configured correctly. Then make sure that each column, the Kanban view, the work that's being done is just very very clear. A lot of this needs to be around that human-centered design, so I think that the onboarding process makes most sense. Like that Get Shit Done mixture of both, select menus of having you connect to GitHub, select the repo you want, and then those probing questions of getting information, getting questions, trying to understand. What needs to be updated. So that's the next thing that I want to work on is making sure that Elmer isn't just a good framework but it's actually easily adaptable by users to get onboarded and then have it configured to exactly what they expect work to look like based on their existing repo.

This is the PM Workspace I keep mentioning: https://github.com/tylersahagun/pm-workspace
