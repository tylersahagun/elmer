The other piece that I can't quite put words into very well, but would be, um, if on the project card, you can see the outcomes, like some sort of metric, a confidence score of how well previous phases went, like, um, based on the context for your workspace, the criteria you're trying to meet, guardrails, company vision, project vision, outcomes you're driving, how well the PRD, the design brief, any of that information. actually matches it so that maybe you can move it into from a PRD into a design and prototype stage, but it'll actually tell you in like a little bar that, hey, this previous stage, this PRD. This was done, but it's actually probably only about 60% of what you want to be on this documentation. So, um, that could also be part of the iterative loop, but not restricting, um, movement between lane by, like it has to hit 100% or a certain metric, but just, um, making it clear that there's always like improvements that can be done and, um, making that iterative cycle very clear.
