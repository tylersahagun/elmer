The question I have now is looking at the GitHub repo. How do I make it the most generic version possible? Where it's all about, it's like a product management workspace still, it's still about this iterative cycle that Sam Ho talks about. Um, that this PM document talks about from, um, open AI. It's adding the actual work to be done by AI agents. The, um, product management. Um, metric analysis, creating new issues is adding that cycle, but with the workspace I have now, how do I make it very generic? So I can add as many submodules as possible from GitHub Repos. I can make new GitHub rebows. I can have self-contained context, and at the same time, um, make sure that the work to be done in each one, like maybe different stages on different, um, workspaces. At the end of the day, I just need to make sure that it is a gorgeous, um, experience and that I can have it be, I can, like, define a generic version that isn't dependent on this ask elephant repo that no matter what the type of application is, the persona, the user, any of those things, that, um, we have a place to start. We can define context and that is all in the same place.
