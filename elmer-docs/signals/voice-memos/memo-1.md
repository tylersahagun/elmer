This is um... This is about the current product management tool. that I'm gonna build. So, I have my setup right now inside of cursor. And the way that it runs is that I have user commands that are basically individual agents and then rules, which is, um, how each of those rules should be used, when they should be used, context, things like that. Um, The current flow for the product process inside of this is that, um, 1st there's a conversation. There's a ticket. There's something that initiates a project to be kicked off. called a feedback ticket. And once that ticket for it, let's say it's a conversation. So it's, we know that there is a project to be done. Work to be done. So what we need to do is say, like, have that conversation, brainstorm, whatever it may be. And then you take the transcript and put it in cursor. And initiate that project. What that project does, what it kicks off, is it looks at the company, um, context, competitors, design language. Marketing, message, sales tactic, personas, all that information, and it goes through and it creates, for that specific feature for the specific product, a PRD document, design, engineering, go to market, briefs for all of those things. It also does research and um, feasibility and then also creates prototype notes. Once that's done, There is a jury for, like, a jury of product managers and a jury of field experts that go in and judge how each of those documents look, like the prototype and the PRD, and they refine those things. After that's done, an initial prototype is made. And that prototype is in 2 different places. One is a standalone prototype that is like the new fresh idea separate from any restraints. And the other is a project context prototype saying, we're gonna look inside of the app that you have, that current components, that current design library, and use all of those components to, um, restrain what that prototype looks like if it were to be put inside the site. So 1st it has to do like a placement analysis of where that would fit best in the user flow, how it might feel to use it there. So it creates those 2 prototypes. Once that is done, you either have users, view, and manage those prototypes, or AI go through with the same jury systems of user personas, like a 1000 user personas that can use the concorded jury system, in order to validate if those are true. So at that stage, you can either use the jury, and you can also use, um, your human feedback with like a new transcript, a new message, anything like that, and have new input. And that is where like this iterative loop starts, is the project starts, you create the documents, and then a 1st prototype is made. And from there, you can decide whether or not you want AI to run through iterations of maybe 5 or 6 and being graded by, um, an AI jury. And then also, if you want people to go through and iterate and do that loop. That loop needs to inform not only the prototype, but also the documentation around work to be done after this is finished. Once, there is a very clear prototype of what needs to be built, as well as design, um, documentation and briefs, as well as, like, PRD documents, then that will be taken and moved into out of prototype phase. Um, the prototypes will be written in storybook next to the code for, um, Next to the code where it would live, like in those true components outside of this workspace. And then have the placement would also say how it connects the actual data structure. So it's not just the UI, but also an analysis of like how this data structure works internally. Um, once That is done, and it's in like this work to be done stage, then it actually needs to define definitive work. So it should be moved into linear tickets or Jira tickets, which would be incredibly small bite-sized pieces. And so this needs to automate both like a project being defined, milestones within it, small bite-sized chunks of issues where actual where AI can go in and use that. Once that's been done, another jury system or AI will analyze and see, hey, are these tickets realistic? And does if each of these were done, would it actually achieve the outcome that we're looking for in our, in our application, in our product, if not, what needs to be changed? So it also goes through an iterative cycle there of even just linking work to be done in the prototypes, to the issues in linear. The important piece there is that if you have a prototype, And then you just create tickets, but don't validate that the tickets will actually make the thing work, then it has to, like, then you lose the value of actually having, like, a functioning prototype in it. Once that piece is done and the work has been defined, then you move it into a new iterative cycle of, um, of buildings. So agents actually will take that, those tickets from linear and start building it in the workspace and doing incremental changes, passing off tickets, being reviewed by other AI to do. in inside of this process. So, Each of those right now, those steps are being done by slash commands. They are being done by manual research about competitors or research about whether or not this function works and getting user feedback. And I still want to be able to have a place to put that information within a project. I'm visualizing this like a conbon board with swim lanes, where I can click new project, it will make those new projects, and I can start adding context, and whenever you move one, um, task into like a project into a new section, it will automatically start running like a CLI job for those cursor agents that are actually managing work to be done. So the work to be done, um, gets that you can decide like how how much in the loop you want to be, how hands-off you want to be, but for example, when it moves into a PRD state, it needs to actually show you the PRD that's been generated in beautiful, um, like it generated and marked down, but then show it to you, like a beautiful notion page, where it allows you to make edits to that document, save it, rerun it, reprocess, and actually interact with the processes that are being done. And then move to, when you put it into like a prototype phase, it will create those prototypes in storybook, hoist them to chromatic, and then chromatic will actually show, or inside storybooks show you in your browser, right there, what it is, then you can have iterative feedback to say, I don't like this, I don't like this. and almost create like a feedback right there for the AI to take, process the feedback from multiple people, and um, start working on it. Um, an important piece of this too would be like a shareable link where you can share the prototype with stakeholders and internal users to test that prototype, um, give feedback and actually iterate on that application. Um, Another important piece of this is that context. So right now the huge value of cursor, um, is that inside of my PM dogs, I have a single, I'm working at one company and all of my projects fall into that one company and they're not like individual products. So everything revolves around like the same company context. But what I would need to do is make it so that each project falls into a given, like, workspace almost, where it's or context, like my personal context or my work context, or even individual product context, where it says, um, this is about my AI chat, or this is about my dog. And as I start to add information, it gains context. It offers to do research on different fields, um, and slowly, slowly builds out the context to improve based on feedback that was received, like if the prototype is like, hey, the color yellow looks really stupid, then, um, it might say that like our colors aren't yellow and start to actually build out that context for each, not only for each project, but the overarching, um, product above it. Um, a big piece of this is also having it so that the agents that are running are being maintained by other agents of like, uh, a cleanup agent that makes sure that transcripts are filed in the correct place and issues are tied to the right thing and there's always an association for a project of like conversations that were had or um, links that were given, tickets from issue, tickets from Pylon, anything like that. So, the overarching idea is that I can look at this conbon board and I hit new projects or I can make a new card at the very 1st and start this process, and what it will do is allow me to enter in a video file, or I can record an audio snippet, or I can, um, have, transcript dropped in or a link to a video, something like that. Then it'll create those, the project and start kicking it off, and then it becomes a card inside my combine view, and I can slide it into different, like, or I can move it into that next stage, and when it moves into the next stage, it automatically kicks off those jobs to be done with clear feedback on, this is the work that is being done right now. Here's the stage that it's at. This is what we want to be done. Um, and I really want the visuals of it to be this very clean white, with rounded edges and corners, and then very, uh, like fine, almost northern lights like a yarn or a, or like fiber threads in the background that are moving in an animation of, like, just a, a, A very soft visual with a gradual animation in the background. of almost like if you were to look at a fiber optic cable and rainbows were flying through it with, um, not quite pastel, but very light colors, uh, that flow through and around the UI elements. And then I want the UI elements also to be similar to, like, liquid glass or, um, other UI elements that are lifted off of the page a little bit, and there's a good feeling of depth that almost like you're stacking, um, weighted blocks on a table so that there's always a sense of, like, of weight and a visual depth outside of it just being flat components on a page. Um, I think that that feel is important to be able to understand. Um, the last thing is that there should be a sidebar chat that you can ask questions about any given projects and, um, ask statuses and it'll help you navigate to different pages and, um, be able to provide context. A big piece of this too is also being able to have like a shared workspace with multiple people. Um, So I can create this workspace and share it with my boss. And so he can be commenting on the prototype that I'm building or someone else can. Um, the last thing is that being able to have projects tied to, um, GitHub Repos. So right now, in Cursor, I have my product like this workspace that has all of the agents in it, with all of my contacts and documents, and then as a submodule, I have my elephant dash AI, GitHub repo. And the nice piece about that is that I can provide prototypes into a specific folder there, but I don't actually have to edit code there, but I want to make sure the prototypes I build can be storybooks inside of my actual app that I can point to component folders or design elements and make sure that as the prototype is being built, it specifically looks at those folders. Um, And as I go through and create a new project, I want to be able to use different context and a different like GitHub repo. For example, we have this a mobile app that doesn't actually work under the same repo. Also, there's a project called Peanut, that's a voice recorder similar to Whisperflow. And I want to be able to also manage that same project with its own context and its own flow. Part of this too could even be whether each swim lane is defined. like we have a pre-built elements of this is how you can get work done, move through those stages of a project, but also add custom columns. So if you want to edit work that's being done in a column, like how many times iterates, how many storybook variations it makes, what structure inside of storybook it is, or maybe it is like you have a PRD one where all it does is make a PRD or you can edit it, make it a PRD, a go to market one, a design one, and then you move into a new, Like you have that PRD column and right next to it is your AI evaluate bucket. So when you move it to AI evaluate, that AI jury will go through and make edits, or someone else might prefer that this is a human in the loop type of thing where you move it in there and it sends it to a select group of people that have to approve it, or just where the user responds and makes comments and edits on that page. I want to build this in next JS, and have it tied to my cursor CI commands, or if there's another way to manage agents that are actually doing that work to be done. The integrations that I think would have to be added is like your GitHub repo, maybe chromatic, if you want to post it or storybook would just show naturally in the app, as well as linear and linear for tickets, as well as Jira, if somebody uses Jira. And then the last piece would be like a document, um, stage where when it's moved into document, you can choose where you want to update, like the knowledge base, the notes, the documentation for users. So this is for a product manager to be able to say, from start to finish, I can plan, design, build, deliver, and execute on all of these steps. especially with that documentation piece of saying, this is the database where I have my notion knowledge base. If anything has ever changed because these projects go update that, or, um, a project is finished, create a new knowledge-based article with images from the prototype with, um, documentation about how it works, how each user persona would use this. Um, the last thing would be putting it into a step of like release and then maybe the actual release stage is like an alpha, a beta, and then a GA stage. And in each of those stages there's different post-hog metrics that are actually being tracked. So when you move it into that stage, it's saying, inside post hog, this is where that feature lives. It's deployed to users. How many users have clicked on it? How many users move away? What metrics are actually tied to each of these stages that we're trying to prove out? And maybe an automatic key that as soon as something hits that post-toc metric, we move it into a beta stage. And as soon as it hits that new next level up metric, it moves into a general availability stage. Whether that's like error messages sent or something similar to it. And once it's in GA, it just becomes this home where you have metrics for that product. that are immediately reported back there. So any given time, I can say, like, I have this project for our CRM experience, and when I click and it's released general availability, I click into the GA and it'll show me metrics from post-hog of how users are using it, tickets that have been accumulated on that one product as well as, um, metrics from my GCP, like my Google Cloud profile of error messages that might be sent to that. So that goes back to my, um, like the engineering and the, uh, original PRD where part of the the design and the linear tickets needs to also be how will we measure and track this in post hog specifically? And later in those stages, what are the metrics that we need to be chasing? and tracking. Um, The last piece there is that if we do finally get to metrics or the metrics start moving really low, the product has already been released, but we want to add features to where we want to edit it. We should be able to create sub projects of that larger project to make new features. So that way we can still see overarching how it does, but now that the product metrics can be tied both to the larger one and also the improvements made. So it can be, I have this CRM agent that I have running, but now I'm making a language model enhancement that the CRM depends on. And now I can say, this improves by 15%, and I see that goes up by 2%. Okay, great. Not only are we having good, um, reactions to this product feature, like the subfeature, but also its parent feature is also improving in the meantime. So we're actually hitting what we want to do. Um, So, this whole entire cycle is this iterative feedback of, like, work that we can do, that we already know that we're getting feedback forward, but also at the end of it is we have released features today that are projects that we have metrics tied to, and, um, as if certain metrics aren't being hit, it should actually create issues to make new PRDs to iterate on the product itself and almost be like a, a, self self-enclosed loop of the product is actually, um, pushing users away most at this stage, this is where we need to improve. So that process is, like, how do we improve what we already have? And then where the human comes in is saying we actually want to innovate and create something new, and we want to try to test, and we want to prototype, and build that out in app, that's where you create a project yourself. So all this needs to be traded in XJS. The question is, is it just a wrapper on top of cursor agents through their CLI? Um, and how do we make that, like, a super cohesive experience that is just very clean? The problem with a lot of these product management tools is that there's just so much at any given time. I want it to look like a, um, like any Apple product demonstration where it is just beautiful, clean, vibrant colors with the most minimal information that is so meaningful, but you can always find more, um, in just a very specific way. So like when I'm looking at post-hoc metrics, I want to just look at those metrics, but I'm looking at GCP metrics. I wanna look at just that. When I'm looking at a PRD, I'm just looking at that. When I'm looking at any of these things, I'm looking like only that specific piece. So I'm going through, I'm iterating, I'm making that process. Um, and then the last thing, like I mentioned, is like having an individual chat on that side panel to be able to say, like, where do I actually need to make efforts, get suggestions for where we actually need human intervention, like prototypes that aren't being validated, any of those things, um, and taking that chat to be able to say, like create issues based on low metrics, um, whatever it may be.
